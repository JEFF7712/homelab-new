# homelab-new

NixOS homelab desired state.

This repository is the source of truth for the new homelab's host, network,
Kubernetes, and external-system configuration. Runtime state and deployment
evidence are kept separate from desired state.

## Ownership

- `flake/` owns NixOS hosts, disks, host networking, k3s installation, and host secrets.
- `tofu/` owns API-managed external systems and supported OPNsense resources.
- `opnsense-reconciler/` owns OPNsense interface and FRR settings absent from the OpenTofu provider.
- `gitops/` owns all Kubernetes objects through Flux.
- `secrets/` contains only SOPS-encrypted material.

The local container registry is owned by `flake/` on `nas-01` and consumed by
k3s through pinned digests in `gitops/` base manifests. Registry content is
represented by the immutable mapping in `registry/images.lock.json`. Image
import, verification, and policy checks are explicit CI or operator actions.
See [`docs/runbooks/local-registry.md`](docs/runbooks/local-registry.md) for
the deployment sequence, credential boundaries, backup and restore procedure,
and rollback rules.

## Deployment

First installation uses `nixos-anywhere`. Subsequent NixOS activation uses `deploy-rs` from the NAS-hosted GitLab runner. OpenTofu applies and OPNsense reconciliation run only in CI. Flux reconciles Kubernetes state from Git.

Do not apply infrastructure from a laptop.

## CI runner lanes

`nas-privileged` is the protected NAS runner for deployment, OPNsense, and
registry import jobs. Its GitLab runner must be locked, protected, limited to
one job, and configured not to accept untagged jobs. Scope `SSH_DEPLOY_KEY`,
`HOSTS_KNOWN`, OPNsense, and registry credentials to the `production`
environment in GitLab.

`nas-ci` is a separate NAS runner for formatting, repository tests,
YAML/schema checks, secret scanning, registry-lock validation, and GitHub sync
across `main`, release tags, and feature branches / merge requests. Register it
with the `nas-ci` tag, locked, with untagged jobs disabled, and unprotected
access level so it can run both protected and feature pipeline jobs. Its
authentication-token file is `/persist/gitlab-runner/ci-authentication-token`;
do not give it deployment, OPNsense, or registry credentials.

## Local workflow

Use the repository's pinned development environment and inspect the current
context before changing files:

```sh
nix develop ./flake
just agent-context
just check-changed
```

Useful registry commands are exposed through `just`:

```sh
just registry-inventory
just registry-resolve
just registry-plan
just registry-check
```

`registry-copy` and `registry-verify` are remote operations and require the
deployment authorization and protected credentials described in the runbook.
Use `just check` for the complete offline validation gate before handoff.
