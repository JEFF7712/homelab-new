# Home Assistant Automation Best Practices

Local reference for agents working in `home-assistant/`. Synthesized from official HA docs (2026.7 release notes, automation trigger/condition/action/mode pages), the `homeassistant-ai/skills` best-practices skill (v31), and community guides (TechDailyAI 2026.7 trigger model, TechFuelHQ practical guide, smarthome-aber-sicher automation mistakes, Zack Wagner unavailable hardening, HomeAutoCentral scenes/scripts/blueprints). Last updated 2026-09-13 against HA 2026.9.1.

Related: `docs/runbooks/home-assistant-configuration.md` (ownership, Workflow A source-first, Workflow B UI adoption, locking, secrets boundary). Read that first before touching `home-assistant/`. This doc covers how to write good automations, not how to deploy them.

## 1. Mental model

Trigger is a moment, condition is a fact, action is the result.

- Trigger: an event that wakes the automation (state change, sun event, time, zone enter/leave, event). One automation can have many triggers; any one firing starts a run.
- Condition: a gate checked at fire time using current state. No trace at all means the trigger never fired; a trace that stops partway means a condition blocked it.
- Action: what runs when trigger fires and conditions pass. Keep it short. If order, timing, waits, or branching matter, put the sequence in a script and call it from the automation.

Since 2026.7, purpose-specific triggers and conditions are the default building blocks (`battery.became_low`, motion detected, temperature crossed threshold). Prefer them over generic state/numeric_state/template equivalents because they handle `unknown`/`unavailable`, event re-arming, and unit quirks internally. Generic triggers still work and are correct when no purpose-specific block fits. This is additive, not a migration tax. Existing YAML keeps running.

Renames to know (old keys no longer load): `battery.low` is now `battery.became_low`, `timer.time_remaining` is now `timer.remaining_time_reached`, `vacuum.docked` is now `vacuum.returned_to_dock`, `update.update_became_available` is now `update.became_available`, trigger `behavior: any`/`last` is now `each`/`all`. Person/device-tracker `entered_home`/`left_home` triggers and `is_home`/`is_not_home` conditions were removed in 2026.5; use `state` trigger `to: home` / `to: not_home`.

## 2. Native-first decision workflow

For every new automation, follow this order:

1. Check for a purpose-specific trigger/condition matching the intent. Prefer area/floor/label targets over entity lists so the automation follows membership as devices change (for example, motion in the living room area, not three named sensors).
2. Fall back to a generic native trigger/condition (`state`, `numeric_state`, `sun`, `time`, `zone`, `event`, `and`/`or`/`not`).
3. Use a template only when 1 and 2 cannot express it. Templates bypass load-time validation and fail silently at runtime.
4. Check for a built-in helper before a template sensor: `min_max` for aggregation, `group` for any-on/all-on, `threshold` for crossing with hysteresis, `derivative` for rate of change, `utility_meter` for consumption. Prefer flow-created Template Helpers (UI editable) over `template:` YAML except for trigger-based templates or custom `attributes:`.
5. Pick the correct run mode (section 3). Default `single` is often wrong.
6. Use `entity_id`, never `device_id` (breaks on re-add). Exceptions: Zigbee2MQTT autodiscovered device triggers are acceptable; ZHA buttons use `device_ieee` in an `event` trigger because ZHA has no event entities; prefer `event.received` on `event.*` entities where the integration exposes one.

Common substitutions:

- `{{ states('x') | float > 25 }}` becomes `numeric_state` condition with `above: 25`.
- `{{ is_state('a','on') and is_state('b','on') }}` becomes `condition: and` with state conditions.
- `{{ now().hour >= 9 }}` becomes `condition: time` with `after: "09:00:00"`.
- `wait_template: "{{ is_state(...) }}"` becomes `wait_for_trigger` with a state trigger. Note the semantic difference: `wait_for_trigger` waits for a change, so if the state is already true it will not proceed immediately. Use a preceding `if` check when you need "already true counts".
- `color_temp` (mireds) is removed since 2026.3. Use `color_temp_kelvin`.
- Hardcoded Blueprint entities, free text where a selector belongs, and `!input` inside a template are blueprint authoring pitfalls. Use typed selectors, bind inputs to `variables:` before templating, always set `source_url`.

## 3. Run modes

| Mode | Re-trigger mid-run | Use for |
| --- | --- | --- |
| `single` (default) | Drop new run, log warning | One-shot notifications, morning routines, weekly jobs |
| `restart` | Stop old run, start over | Motion lights with timeout, stalled detection, auto-off delays |
| `queued` | Run in order after current finishes | Sequential device control, notifications that must not be lost |
| `parallel` | Independent concurrent runs | Per-device actions that do not interact |

`queued` and `parallel` cap at `max: 10` by default. Set `max_exceeded: silent` for intentional throttling (for example, `single` plus a trailing `delay:` as a 5 minute throttle).

The classic bug: motion light with `delay:` in `single` mode. The automation runs for the whole delay, drops re-triggers, then turns the light off while someone is still in the room. Fix is `mode: restart` (timer resets on motion) or `wait_for_trigger` on motion-clear with a timeout.

Scripts have modes too. A `single`-mode script called twice silently ignores the second call.

## 4. Reliability patterns

- Debounce with `for:` on triggers. `for: "00:05:00"` means the state must hold, which suppresses sensor flicker and the restart re-evaluation storm (state triggers re-fire when entities reload after reboot).
- Harden against `unavailable`/`unknown`. Guard both `trigger.from_state` and `trigger.to_state`, not just `to_state`, otherwise `unavailable -> on` after a restart looks like a real event. The deliberate exception: watchdogs that should fire on `unavailable` (bridge offline, device offline) must not use these guards.
- `numeric_state` triggers re-arm on `unavailable` blips, so an unchanged value can fire with no real crossing. Add an explicit condition rejecting `unavailable`/`unknown` in `from_state`.
- Prefer `wait_for_trigger` (event driven) over `wait_template` (polling) and over bare `delay:` for presence timeouts. Always set `timeout:` plus `continue_on_timeout: true` on long waits so one slow device cannot block the routine forever.
- Assume restart amnesia: any in-flight `delay`, `wait_for_trigger`, or `wait_template` is wiped on restart or automation reload with no log. For must-survive timers use a `timer` helper, split into two automations (start event plus deadline trigger with `for:`), or accept and document the gap. Never use a long wait for safety-critical off actions without a fallback trigger (HA start plus state check).
- Separate critical path from enrichment path. Device control, locks, alarm, and safety shutoffs are critical. Phone summaries, TTS chimes, camera snapshots, and cloud calls are enrichment. Put `continue_on_error: true` on enrichment steps only, never on critical steps. A speaker outage must not decide whether away mode armed.
- Consolidate with `choose` and trigger IDs instead of N near-identical automations, but keep the trigger ID mapping honest: every ID must be consumed by exactly one branch, and every branch must name its IDs. The trigger ID trap (ten triggers, one giant choose, actions firing wrongly with no log error) is the most common 2026-era mistake.
- Avoid hardcoded clock times for daylight behavior. Use `sun` triggers and `sun.sun below_horizon` / elevation conditions. A 6 PM lights-on rule is wrong three seasons a year. Fixed times are fine for intentional schedules (wake-up, backup window) but those values should be `input_datetime` helpers when the household may want to tune them.
- Throttle notification-heavy triggers. A `numeric_state below: 30` with no `for:` fires on every 1 percent drop. Add `for:`, a cooldown (`single` plus delay), or an `alert` helper with acknowledgment for critical repeats (water leak, smoke).

## 5. Scenes vs scripts vs automations vs blueprints

- Scene: a saved snapshot of states applied all at once. No order, no delays, no logic. Use for looks (evening relax, movie dim) and for snapshot-restore: `scene.create` with `snapshot_entities` before a temporary override, `scene.turn_on` to restore after. A flat list of set-state actions with no timing is a scene, not a script.
- Script: an ordered recipe with delays, waits, branches, and loops. No triggers; something must call it (button, voice, automation). Use for reusable sequences (notify-all-phones, arrival sequence) and to keep automation action blocks short. Scripts accept fields for parameterization.
- Automation: the only one that watches the world and fires by itself. It decides when. Its action should ideally call a scene (steady-state look) and/or a script (sequenced part).
- Blueprint: a factory that stamps out many independent automations from one template. Use the moment you copy-paste the same logic for a second room or device. Each stamped automation has its own trace and toggle. Fix-once-propagate-everywhere is the win; break-once-propagate-everywhere is the risk, so test a blueprint change on one instance first. Point tunables at helpers (input_number timeout) rather than baking literals into inputs so the household can tune from a dashboard.

Current repo gap: 0 scripts, 0 scenes (except dynamic `scene.create`), 0 blueprints, 0 helpers. Repeated entity lists are copy-pasted across 5 plus automations. Next refactor should introduce at least one notify script, one bedroom-lights script or scene pair, and helpers for thresholds and schedules (section 8).

## 6. Notifications, presence, and use-case catalog

Proven use-case families, with status in this repo:

- Lighting by sun and presence: sunset on, sunrise off, dim late-night, off when away. Covered (bedroom evening presence, stairs sunset to sunrise, living room sign, away enforcement). Missing: illuminance (lux) gating, mmWave hold behavior, adaptive color temperature through the day.
- Away and return: snapshot on leave, enforce off while empty, restore on return, re-apply night lighting on dark return. Covered by `away_lights_off_restore`. Missing: vacation mode helper, guest override, per-person last-leaves logic polish (section 8, finding A2).
- Bedtime and wake: charging-triggered lights-out, low-battery reminder before bed, gentle morning ramp. Covered. Missing: alarm integration (next-alarm sensor), weekend vs weekday schedule, wake-up light fade (`light brightness over time` ramp instead of instant on).
- Appliance and hobby (3D printer): started/finished/error/stalled/idle nudges with progress milestones and camera snapshot. Covered extensively (7 automations). Missing: filament-runout pause hook, enclosure temperature guard, power-loss detection, print-rate-derivative stall signal instead of fixed 15 minutes.
- System health: Zigbee bridge and device offline watchdog, permit-join auto-close, HA update available, startup notify, weekly backup with verification. Covered. Missing: MQTT broker watchdog, Postgres recorder health, disk and backup-age critical alert with repeat-until-acknowledged, integration repair-issue surfacing.
- Battery fleet: low-battery scan with 1 hour debounce. Covered via template scan. Consider migrating to `battery.became_low` purpose-specific trigger or the community low-battery blueprint when available for the installed domains.
- Climate and energy: open-window-while-HVAC guard, eco setback when empty, humidity and mold-risk nudge, energy price shifting. Not covered. The living room AC entity exists (`climate.living_room_ac_living_room_ac_thermostat`) but no automation drives it.
- Safety: water leak with repeating critical alert, smoke/CO escalation, door-left-open with person-home gating, freezer-door ajar. Not covered.
- Network and infra tie-in: restart-safe presence lighting, Cloudflare Tunnel or backup-failure paging, UPS on-battery shutdown staging. Partially covered (startup notify, backup verify). Missing: dead-mans-switch for Flux or k3s (heartbeat sensor plus missed-check-in alert).

When adding a use case, check the community blueprint forum first for motion lighting, low-battery, HVAC window guard, wake-up fade, and critical repeating notifications. Importing a vetted blueprint beats hand-rolling fiddly timer-reset and override logic.

## 7. Debugging and day-two operations

- Traces first: Settings, Automations, open automation, Traces. Shows trigger values, per-condition pass/fail, per-action outcomes. No trace means the trigger never fired, look upstream, not at actions.
- Run actions manually from the three-dot menu to test the action block in isolation (skips triggers and conditions). Test a single condition from its own three-dot menu. Live condition badges (since 2026.6) show pass/fail in real time.
- Developer Tools States shows real entity states (check `unknown`/`unavailable` before blaming logic). Developer Tools Template renders Jinja against live state. Developer Tools Events reveals exact event names and payloads for event triggers.
- Logs: Settings, System, Logs, filtered by automation or entity name. Template errors now appear in traces.
- Recorder growth: this repo uses external Postgres (`recorder.db_url` via `!secret`), which avoids SQLite bloat. Keep `purge_keep_days` and `commit_interval` intentional, exclude noisy domains fromRecorder when adding cameras or power sensors, and note that 30-day trace retention costs database space.
- Backup before risky work: full backup before upgrades, blueprint conversions, and entity renames. A single-object rollback beats a full restore, which discards every unrelated change since the archive and restarts HA. Never delete a backup or start a Core/OS upgrade without explicit user confirmation.

## 8. Audit of current setup (2026-09-13)

Offline validation: `just ha-validate` passes (44 resources clean). Live diff/verify not run in this pass (needs `HASS_TOKEN`); re-run `just ha-diff` and `just ha-verify` before changing behavior.

Inventory drift: `inventory.yaml` claims 15 automations but `home-assistant/automations/` contains 21 files. Refresh with `just ha-inventory` / `just ha-capture` and commit the result so the baseline matches reality.

### Strengths to preserve

- Sun-driven lighting throughout (no hardcoded dusk/dawn times except intentional schedules). `stairs_light_sunset_to_sunrise` and `living_room_sign_by_presence` are exemplary minimal automations.
- Snapshot-restore away pattern via `scene.create`/`scene.turn_on` in `away_lights_off_restore`. This is the textbook scene use and is done correctly.
- `wait_for_trigger` with timeout in `a1_print_stalled_detection` instead of polling. Correct primitive, wrong mode (see P1 below).
- `weather.get_forecasts` with `response_variable` in `morning_weather_briefing`. Correct modern pattern, not the deprecated forecast attribute.
- Battery scan excludes non-numeric states (`is_number` filter) and uses `default(..., true)` fallbacks in printer messages. Good unavailable hygiene in messages.
- Zigbee permit-join auto-close (5 minutes plus notify) and offline watchdog with `for:` debouncing. Correct security and flapping posture.
- Modern action keys (`triggers`/`actions`/`action:`) and `color_temp_kelvin`. No `device_id`, no `service:` legacy keys, no `color_temp` mireds.

### Findings (ordered by priority)

P0, false-start notify on `a1_print_started`: the guard condition explicitly allows `unknown` and `unavailable` as `from_state` values, so `unavailable -> running` after a restart sends a phantom Print Started notification. Fix: allow only real predecessor states (`idle`, `finish`, `failed`, and `paused` if the integration uses it), drop `unknown`/`unavailable`.

P0, unguarded `to: finish`/`to: failed` transitions: `a1_chamber_light_auto_off`, `a1_print_finished`, and the `failed` leg of `a1_print_error` fire on `unavailable -> finish`/`failed` with no `from:` guard. Add `from:` (for example, `from: running`) or a template condition rejecting `trigger.from_state.state in ('unknown','unavailable','none')`.

P1, wrong modes on delay/wait automations: `a1_chamber_light_auto_off` (`delay: 5 min` in `single` drops overlapping finishes and dies on restart; use `restart` plus document the restart gap, or a `timer` helper for survival), `a1_print_stalled_detection` (15 minute `wait_for_trigger` in `single` drops a second print started mid-wait; use `restart` so the newest print owns the timer).

P1, notification spam on `phone_bedtime_low_battery_reminder`: `numeric_state below: 30` with no `for:` notifies on every 1 percent drop all evening. Add `for: "00:05:00"` (or a cooldown) and consider `max_exceeded: silent`.

P1, two-person race in `away_lights_off_restore`: the snapshot is taken only on the `away` leg (Rupan leaves), not on `left_empty` (Sam leaves last). If Rupan is already away when Sam leaves, the enforce-off runs with no fresh snapshot and a later return restores a stale scene. Fix: snapshot on `left_empty` when no snapshot exists yet, or snapshot on both legs. Also consider `mode: queued` so `away`, `left_empty`, and `enforced` legs cannot drop each other; the current `single` mode can silently drop enforcement triggers.

P2, restart amnesia on long waits: `a1_print_idle_reminder` (1 hour `for:`), `a1_chamber_light_auto_off` (5 minute `delay`), `weekly_backup_verify` (1 hour `wait_template`), and the stall detector (15 minute wait) all reset silently on restart. Acceptable for reminders, not for safety offs. At minimum document the gap in each description; for the chamber light add a HA-start reconciliation trigger (if print status is not running and chamber light is on, turn it off).

P2, `weekly_backup_verify` uses `wait_template` where `wait_for_trigger` on the backup sensor is the preferred primitive, and its success message renders the post-wait state (correct) but has no failure escalation beyond one phone note. Add a repeat or persistent notification on the failure leg.

P2, `a1_print_progress_milestones` defines trigger IDs (`p25`/`p50`/`p75`) but never uses them; the message re-reads the progress sensor, which is fine but makes the IDs dead weight. Either use `trigger.id` in the message or drop the IDs. Also add an unavailable guard: bare `above:` triggers re-arm on blips.

P2, entity hygiene: Zigbee plugs still carry IEEE-ish IDs (`switch.0xffffb40e0608c96f` etc.) repeated across 6 plus automations, and only 2 of the implied set carry the `shared_space` label while `away_lights_off_restore` targets both the label and hardcoded lists. Rename to functional IDs (`switch.bedroom_window_plug`) via the safe-refactoring workflow (impact analysis across automations, scripts, scenes, dashboards, and config-entry data, then group membership repair), or at minimum converge all shared-space members onto the label and target the label everywhere.

P2, DRY violation: `bedroom_lights_evening_presence` repeats the same five-entity blocks four times. Extract a `script.bedroom_lights_evening` (or a scene pair for full vs dim-warm) and call it from the four branches. Same for the bedroom off-block shared with `bedroom_lights_bedtime_charging` and the away routine.

P2, missing tunability: thresholds and times are literals scattered across files (20 percent battery, 30 percent phone, 5 minutes, 1 hour, 22:00, 08:00). Promote the ones the household may tune to helpers (`input_number`, `input_datetime`, `input_boolean` vacation/guest/night) and reference them, so tuning does not require YAML edits.

P2, stairs light uses sunset at 0 degrees; if the stairwell still feels dark too early or late in the year, switch to a sun elevation trigger around minus 4 degrees.

P2, `ha_core_update_available` fires on any sensor change with only a `to_state` guard. Add a `from_state` guard or an explicit old-vs-new version comparison so a restart blip cannot notify.

### Suggested next automations (highest value first)

1. Fix the P0 guards above before adding anything. Phantom printer notifications erode trust fastest.
2. Climate guard: window open while living room AC runs (notify plus set HVAC off after 3 minutes, re-armed on both edges). AC entity already exists and has no automation.
3. Critical-alerts script with repeat-until-acknowledged for water/smoke/freezer when those sensors arrive; route existing failure legs (backup failed, print error) through it.
4. `input_boolean.vacation_mode` plus `input_boolean.guest_mode` gates on evening and away automations; one dashboard card to flip them.
5. Bedroom wake-up fade via brightness ramp tied to next-alarm sensor, replacing the instant 08:00 on.

## 9. Repo conventions (must follow)

- One file per automation under `home-assistant/automations/`, filename equals automation `id` (for example, `stairs_light_sunset_to_sunrise.yaml` holds `id: stairs_light_sunset_to_sunrise`). Required keys: `id`, `alias`, `description`, `triggers`, `actions`. Always set `mode` explicitly even when `single` is intended, so the choice is visible.
- Human-readable `alias` values prefixed by area or domain (`Bedroom Lights: ...`, `A1: ...`, `Zigbee: ...`, `System: ...`, `Away: ...`). Descriptions state intent and any accepted restart gap.
- No plaintext secrets. `!secret` references only. `just ha-validate` secret-scans before persistence; keep LLATs in `HASS_TOKEN`, `HASS_TOKEN_FILE`, or `.agent-state/home-assistant/token`, never in Git.
- Workflow: Workflow A for new asks (inspect with `just ha-diff`, edit Git source, `just ha-validate`, `just ha-plan --select <kind>/<key>`, commit and deploy, then `just ha-verify`). Workflow B for UI experiments (diff, `just ha-adopt --select`, validate, commit). Revert only on explicit user request (`just ha-revert --select`). Pause UI edits on target resources during apply; the tool enforces read-before-write and lease locking.
- Validation gate before handoff: `just ha-validate` and `just check-changed` at minimum. `nix develop ./flake -c bash scripts/checks/home-assistant.sh` is the canonical offline check per `AGENT_MAP.md`.
- Never hand-edit `.storage/`, never generate YAML snippets for manual pasting when the config API path exists, never tell the user to edit `configuration.yaml` for a UI-configurable integration.
