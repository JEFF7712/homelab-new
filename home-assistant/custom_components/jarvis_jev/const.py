# Risk tiers for execution. Every action the router can emit must appear in

# pass the structural and confidence gates. RESTRICTED actions always route
# to clarify: locks, garage doors, alarms, HVAC extremes, and anything
# destructive require explicit confirmation, never silent execution.
# The schema has no restricted actions today; adding one (e.g. a lock
# domain) must add it here first or the tier test fails.
